- 👋 Hi, I’m @jrojass (Jonathan Rojas-Simón), a software engineer and a master's in computer science.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing Natural Language Processing tools and resources to solve human-communication problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning transformer-based methods for solving Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on several NLG projects from the language neutrality approach.
- 📫 How to reach me is by my personal e-mail (ids_jonathan_rojas@hotmail.com) or my ResearchGate profile (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan-Rojas-2).
